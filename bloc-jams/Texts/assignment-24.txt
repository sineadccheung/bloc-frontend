var text = element.textContent;
element.textContent = "this is some sample text";


While textContent gets the content of all elements, including <script> and <style> elements, the IE-specific property innerText does not.
innerText is aware of style and will not return the text of hidden elements, whereas textContent will.
As innerText is aware of CSS styling, it will trigger a reflow, whereas textContent will not.
Unlike textContent, altering innerText in Internet Explorer (up to version 11 inclusive) not just removes child nodes from the element, 
but also permanently destroys all descendant text nodes 
(so it is impossible to insert the nodes again into any other element or into the same element anymore).
